The other night I watched a Russian movie called [Night Watch](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0403358/ "Nochnoy Dozor (Night Watch)"). It was fantastic, the best vampire movie that I've seen in a long, long time.

The entire movie was well done, but the thing that made me enjoy it so much was that they didn't try to make it PG 13 to maximize profit, but seemed to stick to aiming it at adults. It was nice to see something with rough edges in a world that is all too often filled with pastel Disney niceties (not that I don't appreciate those, as well, I just want to see other stuff too).

The visuals were great, creating the feel of the movie: dark, rough, somewhat ambiguous. The story was good, too, but I want to read the books now to see if they have a bit more character development.

If you rent/buy this (and you should), the disc has two sides, subbed and dubbed. I watched a few minutes of the dubbed version, and it was pretty good, but the subtitles were fantastic. This is what subtitles should be, not something tacked onto the movie, but something that blends into the movie.
