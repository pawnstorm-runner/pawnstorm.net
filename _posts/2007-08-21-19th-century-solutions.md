So I ran across this quote earlier today over at [Bike Portland](http://bikeportland.org/2007/08/06/house-passes-energy-plan-despite-ridicule-over-bike-commuter-benefit/ "Bike Portland"), and even though I usually don't do the whole political thing (I don't particularly like either party), as a cyclist I needed to comment on this. The rest of his speech is available at his site, but basically he is saying that spending $1 million to promote cycling is a waste of money. There are a lot of things I want to say about this, but I'll just list a couple here.

First, how is promoting a means of transportation that is cheaper, easier on the environment, reduces traffic congestion, and helps to promote a healthy lifestyles a bad thing? Even if you only agree with a couple of those reasons, do you really think that $1 million is too much to spend? Why?

Second, I would argue that getting from point A to point B despite scarcity of resources is as much of a 11th century problem as a 21st century problem. By his argument, you could say that building homes is a 21st century problem (after all, we are doing it now, and it is the 21st century). Does that mean that nails, screws, and [simple machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_machine "Simple Machines") are no longer adequate?

Keep in mind that I am not saying that cycling is the final solution to our energy problems, it isn't. But it is part of the solution, and given the [advantages](http://www.biketraffic.org/btwg/whyemployees.htm "Why bike to work?"), spending some money to encourage it is a reasonable course of action.
