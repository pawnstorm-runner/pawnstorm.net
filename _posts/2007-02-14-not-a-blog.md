title: This is not a blog.

Yes, yes, I know, its on Blogger, which sort of makes it a blog. But I don’t intend to do much, if any, actual blogging. Instead, what I am planning on doing is to use this site as an online home for my work. Hence, none of that “this was my day, isn’t my cat cute” stuff. So don’t get upset if you don’t find that here.

Shit. This was a blog post, wasn’t it.
