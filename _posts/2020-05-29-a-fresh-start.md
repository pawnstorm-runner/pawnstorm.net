title: A Fresh Start

It took a bit of work, but if you're reading this I have successfully switched from Wordpress to Jekyll. As of now, there are some things that I still need to take care of (getting the navbar to highlight correctly, adding some of the images back in, etc.) but the bulk of the work is done. There's a bit more detail about this site's current incarnation over on the [About page]({% link about.md %}), but the short version is that I ran across Tom MacWright's [website](https://macwright.org) a couple of weeks ago and realized that I could fix the things that had bothered me about this site for years now (how slow Wordpress was, the difficulty of finding a theme that I liked, etc.).

Everything important from the old site should be moved over at this point, including all of my fiction and any blog posts with actual content (it was difficult to not edit them).

I'm still figuring out how I want to proceed from here. There's a lot to do and I don't want to get burned out. Here are some of the ideas that I have:
- Figure out a way of doing a regular blog post to keep things alive here and to track what's going on in my head that doesn't quite rise to the level of a post. I'm experimenting with keeping track of links to articles I read to do some sort of monthly post. I'm not sure if this will be closer to MacWright's [Recently](https://macwright.org/2020/05/01/recently.html) posts, Keith Law's [Stick to Baseball](http://meadowparty.com/blog/2020/05/23/stick-to-baseball-5-23-20/) posts, something else entirely.
- Regularly update the Recommended page. I'm not sure if the interval should be weekly or less frequent. I also need to come up with some criteria for how I'll do it.
- I've been wanting to write again, and I'd like to do a bit more with my fiction. Publishing short stories as ebooks kind of worked, but I don't think that the effort:benefit ratio was very good. Also, since I'm not looking at writing as a potential income stream these days, I'm even less concerned with profitability than I was before. Instead, I'm looking for discoverability. That being said, the [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) model (Publish One's Self, Syndicate Elsewhere) sounds pretty appealing. I might experiment with sites like Medium.
- I want to document some of the [Projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects.html) I work on. Currently that page has a couple of things I've done for Netrunner, but eventually I would like for it to include some of my offline projects, as well.

In any case, I think that's enough for now. See you all around.
