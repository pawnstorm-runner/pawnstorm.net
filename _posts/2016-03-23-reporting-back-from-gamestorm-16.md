Last weekend I was at [GameStorm 18](http://www.gamestorm.org/), Portland's regional board game convention. I had a great time, and got to play a bunch of stuff:

- Steam
- Splendor (x2)
- Favor of the Pharaoh (x2)
- Raiders of the North Sea
- The King is Dead
- Traders of Osaka
- Dice City
- One Zero One
- Krosmaster: Arena (x2)
- Skull King
- Lifeboat (with the Cannibalism expansion)
- Shipwrights of the North Sea (with Townsfolk Expansion)
- Isle of Trains
- Fleet (with all the expansions)
- Ca$h 'n Guns (second edition)
- Swinging Jivecat Voodoo Lounge
- Eurorails
- Medina
- Inglorious Space

Overall, I had a great time. I didn't run into any annoying people, and nothing I played fell flat (although a couple weren't as fun as I expected). Here are some of the highlights:

[**Eurorails**](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/157/eurorails) - This is something that I have been wanting to play for literally years (rather, I've been wanting to play any Crayon Rails game), but the weight of the game and long play time has been problematic. I definitely want to play more Crayon Rails games, and will probably buy/trade for Nippon Rails at some point.

[**Raiders of the North Sea**](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/170042/raiders-north-sea) - This game was just awesome, probably the best Kickstarter I've backed. In some ways it reminds me of Tzolk'in, but is a bit lighter and the rules are much more intuitive. I'm not sure if I had as much fun playing it as I did with Eurorails, but it will be much easier to get to the table. ([Shipwrights](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/75547/shipwrights-north-sea) was also great, the expansion really brings a lot to the game without adding much complexity.)

[**Inglorious Space**](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/196165/inglorious-space) - This game came as a complete surprise to me, given that I had never heard of it before playing it (not surprising since it is only a few days into its Kickstarter campaign), but I loved it. Based on classicÂ space shooters like Galaga, it is a multiplayer with a semi-co-op mechanic. I had been excited about The Battle at Kemble's Cascade, but after looking into it more, it just sounded tedious. Inglorious Space, on the other hand, plays quick, light, and fun, but has enough depth to keep it interesting. I'm definitely looking forward to playing it more.

[**Isle of Trains**](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/154906/isle-trains) - Another game that I had never heard of. This is a tiny (52 card?) game about building a train and fulfilling contracts. It had some depth, interesting decisions, and good interaction. For $10, I can't think of a good reason not to buy it.

All in all, a great weekend. Looking forward to [GameStorm 19](http://www.gamestorm.org/shop/memberships/gamestorm-19-membership/).
