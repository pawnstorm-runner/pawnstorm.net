May is National Short Story Month, and what better way to celebrate short stories than by writing some? I think that the goal should be to complete a polished short story, and so the schedule would go something like:

Week 1 - Write a rough draft of a short story 2,500 - 7,500 words in length.

Week 2 - Read and critique a bunch of other people's short stories.

Weeks 3 and 4 - Successive drafts, more critiquing, celebration.

What do you think?

**UPDATE:** ShoStoWriMo went great, and will happen again next year, but until then, the site has been temporarily shut down (It will be back up in April of 2012). See you next year!
