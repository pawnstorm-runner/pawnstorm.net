If you ever find yourself in San Francisco, do yourself a favor and go to [Zante's Pizza & Indian Cuisine](http://www.zantepizza.com/) and get an Indian Pizza (they have several varieties vegan, vegetarian, and with meat). I've never found anything else like it.

What is an Indian Pizza? Well, if you took a tasty pizza dough and instead of putting the usual toppings on it instead covered it with indian food, you'd have a good idea of what I'm talking about. Every bite is a different flavor of Indian food, and every bite is delicious. Even if you don't like Indian food, you should try it.

It is also worth noting that that I have seen Indian pizza elsewhere, too, but it is usually much closer to a traditional pizza (red sauce, mozzarella) with some Indian toppings. Zante's, on the other hand, is more akin to Indian - Italian fusion. To get an idea of what I'm talking about, here's the list of toppings for the original best Indian pizza:
- Spinach
- Egg Plant
- Cauliflower
- Ginger
- Garlic
- Green Onions
- Cilantro
- Lamb
- Tandoori Chicken
- Prawns

Finally, I should mention that Zante's saved my marriage. "How?" you ask. Well, back when my partner and I lived in San Francisco, we realized that almost all of our arguments started the same way, with the innocuous question: "What do you want for dinner?" Usually, one of us would have something in mind and everything would be good. If neither of us had a strong preference, however, we would circle around and around, neither of us wanting to force the other eat something that we didn't feel that strongly about ourselves. Eventually, this would continue until we got hangry and then one of us would say something that we regretted.

Enter the "Zante's Rule". Once we realized what was happening, it was relatively easy to figure out a way around it. Since I could always go for pizza, and my partner could always go for indian food, if our dinner discussion had gon past the 5-minute mark, before it could turn into something more akin to trench warfare we would just order from Zante's. And so, for the remainder of time that we lived in San Francisco, most of our arguments were averted.

In retrospect, the Zante's Rule seems really close to some of what [Algorithms to Live By](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250118363) was talking about, so if you found this interesting, you might want to give the book a try. Or, just go get yourself a tasty, tasty Indian Pizza.

*Note: I know that the website lists the name as Zante Pizza, not Zante's Pizza. Since the magnet on my fridge says Zante's, I'm going with that.*
