title: Possible Disruption in Service
---
I've been planning on changing my current host setup for a while now, since it has been getting less reliable (it takes way more work than it should to upload a few files via ftp, for example) and has always been slow. But I just got a notice that my hosting plan is up for renewal at the beginning of December, so the timeline has been moved up from "eventually" to by the end of November to avoid that renewal.

The plan is to move pawnstorm.net over to GitHub Pages, and I am pretty much done cloning the site over to its new home. Unfortunately, while GitHub totally supports Jekyll, hosting there definitely has some quirks. I'm hoping to begin the process on Saturday night and if all goes well it should be seamless. However, I've done enough of this sort of thing to know that it could go totally sideways. Here are some things that could happen during the process:
* The site could go down for a while. 24 hours certainly isn't out of the realm of possibility.
* Internal links could totally break. Most of the work of cloning the site has been figuring out how to get my Jekyll setup to play well with GitHub's structure. I think that I have it figured out, but we'll see.
* RSS (web feed), could get seriously messed up, up to and including thinking that everything here is brand new and sending subscribers all the posts.

In any case, I'll do my best to avoid all of that stuff, but consider yourself warned.
