This was supposed to be posted on the 20th of last month, but due to operator error, it wasn't. Oops.

## Books

_Last Week:_ The Statues That Walked, Ship Breaker, The Quantum Thief, The Third Reich, and One Way Forward. Of these five, my favorites were definitely The Statues That Walked, which made a rather persuasive argument that rather than polluting themselves to death/killing each other, the people of Easter Island were both peaceful and remarkably good stewards of the environment, and One Way Forward, which was one of the most hope-inducing political book that I've read in a long time.

_This Week:_ Ragamuffin, Fever Crumb, and Dark Life. All of them were good, but nothing really bit me.

Then again, I check oil-price.net every morning because it seems to be the best single indicator of what will happen in our society, so I may be a bit biased on this front.
- [A Writing Experiment](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2012/03/a-writing-experiment-i-plan-to.html) - Basically, using Apple's Siri to capture dialogue and a keyboard to capture the rest of the story. I'm not sure how well this will work out, as real speech makes terrible dialogue. Of course, I am still planning on writing a story that involves a group of people sending frantic status updates via text message, which I plan to frantically type into my phone to capture some of the autocorrect hilarity.
- [Locke Lamora Read-Along Bonus #4: YOU SUCK, LYNCH](http://scott-lynch.livejournal.com/271983.html) - Lynch provides some fascinating insight into what it means to not go back and fix the things that you wrote years ago, when you lacked the skills you currently possess.

Way to shoot yourself in both feet, publishing industry.
- [E-Books' Uncertain Future at Local Libraries](http://perryhall.patch.com/articles/an-uncertain-future-for-e-books-at-your-local-library) - I realize that this is a tough time for publishers, but I fail to see the rationale of not selling to libraries at all.
