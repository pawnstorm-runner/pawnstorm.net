I'm not quite sure what to call this. It's not poetry and not really prose. In any case, I wrote it when my friend Mike left town, and I think that you may enjoy it:

#### Analog

They say that we now live in a digital world, that reality is being subsumed by a tidal wave of bits so massive that it will one day swallow theÂ  entire universe. They believe that this seemingly perfect map that is coming into being will one day surpass the original in scope, detail, and quality.

It cannot.

For in its precision, it forgets that though you may leave, you take us with you just as we keep some small part of you here. In a digital world, you cannot be both here and there, and yet there you are, and here you are.

So farewell, friend, and remember that the world was, is, and always will be, analog.
