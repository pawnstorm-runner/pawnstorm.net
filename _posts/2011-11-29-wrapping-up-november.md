Only two days left in November. Whew. It's been a busy month. I've gotten a lot of work done on [Caldera](http://pawnstorm.net/?page_id=83), although it has gone slower than I would like. I'm hoping to finish it tomorrow. I've started a new project, [Soapbox](http://pawnstorm.net/?page_id=551), which has been a fun experiment (and will continue to be so with any luck). Finally, I finished [Trust and Vulnerability](http://brokenshores.com/?page_id=393) over at [Broken Shores](http://brokenshores.com/), and it has been well received. Â All in all, I've written something like 15-20k words this month.

As for reading, I've been continuing to read [A Year in the Life of a Shinto Shrine](http://www.powells.com/biblio/2-9780295975009-2), which has continued to be rewarding. Also, I have started to make my way through Neal Stephenson's new book, Reamde, with which I have to be careful or else it will take over my life for a few days as I do nothing but read it. Finally, I've read some good short stories, most notably [The Things](http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/watts_01_10/) by Peter Watts, which is the story of the creature from the movie The Thing, but from the Thing's perspective.

I'm not sure how much I'm going to get done next month, hopefully a short story and flash piece for Broken Shores, more Soapbox, and maybe a new [Horizon](http://pawnstorm.net/?page_id=67) story (Interstellar Fish Larceny FTW!), maybe I'll even get around to revising Caldera. Also, I want to make some improvements to this site (I want classification icons for the stories here: funny, SF, fantasy, free, etc.). In any case, I have a lot of writing ahead of me today, but there will be a new Soapbox piece tomorrow and a progress update for Caldera the day after.
