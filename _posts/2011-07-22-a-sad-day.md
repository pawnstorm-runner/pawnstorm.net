You may have heard that Borders has gone out of business and is in the process of being liquidated. I worked for Borders, and will be spending the next month or two liquidating the the place where I used to work. As you can imagine, this is a tough time for me. Since none of my projects really fit with how I feel, I will be putting them on hold for a while and working on something else that is a bit more appropriate (it involves squirrel zombies). I'll let you know when I have more to say about it (hopefully in a week or two, the story is pretty fleshed out in my mind).

Until then, don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I have a wonderful wife and a great group of friends.
