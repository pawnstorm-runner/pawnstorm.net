My first time through Marcus Aurelius's Meditations, I didn't really get the first book, where he basically pays tribute to everyone who had influenced him. On subsequent readings, I realized that he was also using that section to list virtues and that it was an important part of the book. Furthermore, when I started thinking about how to forgive someone for whom I bear a grudge, one of the practices that occurred to me is to focus on what they had given me rather than what they had taken away, so I am doing that here, too.
