This route is one of the reasons I'm writing this guide, since it took some doing to figure out and isn't at all intuitive. As far as I can tell, there isn't a good direct way to get to Hawks Prairie by bicycle from... anywhere, really. I'm guessing that it has something to do with it being a more recently developed area, so while there are places with bike lanes, very few of those bike lanes are somewhere where I would want to ride, either being in an area that isn't really connected to the rest of the bike network or being painted onto the side of a busy road (I'm not very risk averse when I'm riding alone, but even without my kid in tow, I'm not going to ride on the side of Martin Way).

## The Route
1.  Starting at Target in Lacey, hop on the Chehalis Western Trail and head south (left). When you get to the bike roundabout, take another left so that you are heading east on the Woodland trail.
2. The trail is pretty easy to follow, with one exception. When you reach the first roundabout where Lacey splits off from Pacific, it looks like you can go either way around the roundabout, but staying on the right-hand side of the roundabout feels less awkward to me. Eventually, you will come to a second roundabout, a 5-way one where Lacey converges back in with Pacific. Once you follow it around the trail splits with the right fork heading to the Woodland Creek Park and the left fork continuing for 100 feet or so. Take the left fork and continue on the sidewalk until you reach Carpenter Rd., where you will make a left.
3. Along Carpenter there is one of those weird sidewalks that doesn't know whether it wants to be a sidewalk or a bike path, since it is almost wide enough. It's not the sort of thing I normally ride on, on principle, but not hiding in dangerous traffic is the superceding principle here. Fortunately, there is almost never anyone walking here, so it hasn't been an issue.
4. Don't take the first street you come to (6th Ave), it will just loop back to Pacific. The second street (5th Way) connects, but there are some unpleasant hills if you take that route. What you want is Husky Way, which is almost all the way to Martin (literally, it is like 100 feet before the intersection). Take a right on Husky.
5. Follow Husky to Wildcat and take a left, follow the curve right, then take a left on Ranger. When you cross Martin, Ranger becomes Hensley (because of course it does) and you then get to the part where I always get lost and have to look at a map.
6. Take your first right on 11th, which curves to the left and turns into Home (St? ), then take a right on 13th Ave. Follow that pretty much to the end, where you can take a left on Ivy or Clover (either one works) then a right on 13th Way (yeah, I know, it doesn't make sense that there are two 13ths here, but that is residential street names for you).
7. 13th Way goes for a very short distance, then becomes a brief, curvy trail with *very* bumpy asphalt pushed up by tree roots. From here you can cross the street to get your kid's hair cut or go get a burger or something. Congratulations!

## Alternatives
* Yeah, it would be a lot more direct to take Martin, but having ridden on Martin, I'm hesitant to do so again, especially if I have my kid with me.

## Points of Interest
* The Woodland Creek Park is really nice. It has a good playground and a disc golf course (though I have never disc golfed, so no idea if it's any good). Definitely a nice place for a picnic.

## Notes
* I ended this route at the strip mall area where Jack & Jill's is located, there is a bunch of stuff around here, including Fred Meyer, Costco, and Best Buy, all pretty easy to get to by bike. This area is a pretty reasonable alternative to the mall, but is definitely car-centric.
* I need to do some exploring to see if I can find a way around using the sidewalks on Pacific, maybe following the right fork and taking Carpenter from there?
* Check to see if Husky is really better than 5th
