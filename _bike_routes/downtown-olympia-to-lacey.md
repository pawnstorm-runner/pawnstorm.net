This is a really straightforward route, and is a pleasant ride, to boot. Once you're on the Woodland Trail you're good to go. Getting to the trail is a bit tricky, however.

## The Route
1. Head South from the Olympia Transit Center. It isn't terribly important which street you take, all of them are pretty calm since almost all traffic ends up on Capitol or Plum, but I usually take Franklin (which has the benefit of going right by the library).
2. I usually jog East after passing the library, so that I'm crossing Union at Jefferson. This is the least pleasant part of the ride. The post office on Jefferson generates sums traffic and Union is a busy street. If you continue to follow Jefferson, there is a bike lane, but I find it much more pleasant to ride half a block East on Union and go up Cherry, which allows you to take quiet neighborhood streets all the way to the Woodland Trail connector(?)
3. The connector will take down a hill and up the other side until it terminates at Eastside St., where it terminates. Although there is no signage, if you look to the right you can see the entrance to the Woodland Trail. Take the bike lane and ride up a bit more of a hill and you will be ready to get on the trail.
4. Once you're on the Woodland Trail, you will quickly see why it forms one of the backbones of cycling infrastructure for the area. Eastbound, it is uphill the entire way, but with such a gentle grade that you might not even notice it. In addition, it runs through forest for almost the entire distance, making it a pleasant ride even on hot days. Take the trail until you reach the connection with the Chehalis Western Trail.
5. Head north on the Chehalis Western Trail by taking the third exit on the bike roundabout (there should be more bicycle roundabouts in the world). The trail has its own overpass over Pacific, which is really nice, and there are several exits directly into the Target parking lot.


## Getting Back
This route is almost exactly the same on the way back. Just get back to the Woodland Trail and you'll be back downtown in no time. Although the grade is barely noticeable on the way out, the slight downhill will speed things up on the way back.

## Alternatives
* 4th to Eastside

## Points of Interest
* Centennial Park
* Yashiro Japanese Garden
* Capitol Campus
* Olympic Cards & Comics (Gabi's)
* As a general rule, Lacey has better ethnic food than Olympia, which makes sense given that it is more diverse. If you're looking for something to eat, Safuras has some super tasty schawarmas near the end of the route.

## Notes
* The trail is not lit, and I have seen evidence of unhoused communities in the woods. Personally, I have ridden the trail as early as 6 am and as late as about 1 am and have never run into any trouble or felt unsafe in anything other than an abstract sense. However, I can totally imagine not wanting to ride this alone at night. Then again, if you are out riding at 1 am, riding through mostly deserted streets without cars around is a real treat, so you might want to skip the trail anyway.
* At the north end of the Target parking lot is an entrance onto the I-5 Trail. If you head west on it, it will take you through a cute little park which is a nice place for a picnic (I-5 park) and let you out on 3rd Ave, which you can follow to St. Martin's University, Lacey City Hall, and the Lacey Timberland Library (all across College St.).
