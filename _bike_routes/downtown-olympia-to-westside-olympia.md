It is a bit ironic that one of the best-marked routes on this list is also one of the most intuitive. This route really reminds me of [The Wiggle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wiggle) in San Francisco, which passes is a winding valley that allows you to get from downtown to Golden Gates Park with a total climb of 120 feet. Granted, the climb here is more like 300 ft, but the instructions are the same, whenever you have the choice between steep and less steep, take the easier route.

## The Route
1. Start by riding up the 4th Ave bridge to the first roundabout, take the bike lane up to the second roundabout, and cross West Bay Drive.
2. From here it looks like you have a grueling climb up Harrison, but about 60 meters past the roundabout you come to Sherman, which is a markedly easier grade.
3. From there, you zigzag through the Westside neighborhoods until you get to Division, and from there the grade is pretty flat to wherever you need to go. Signage is good on this route (with one exception where the sign appears to point into an alley), follow it and you're good to go.

## Alternatives
* If you want to challenge yourself, at the first roundabout you can take Olympic Way to 5th Ave and climb straight up. There's much less traffic here than on 4th or Harrison, so safety and dignity (should you rethink your choice of routes midway through) are improved.
* For an easier climb, Olympia has good, free bus service and the busses have bike racks. No judgements, honest. Public transit is the next best thing to cycling, in my book.

## Points of Interest
* The Garfield Overlook trail is my favorite walk within city limits. Do yourself a favor and check it out.
* The Westside Food Co-op is just off the route. It's smaller than the Eastside location, but nice.

## Notes
* If you're thinking that you can get to Trader Joe's or Barnes & Noble from here, that's technically true, but there isn't anything resembling a good route. I usually take Division/Black Lake Blvd until the bike lane runs out then hop on the sidewalk to get down the hill. Riding on the sidewalk is something that I believe adult cyclists should almost never do, but this part of town is clearly not designed for anyone not in a car. There's probably a bus that'll get your there, but I honestly just avoid the place these days.
